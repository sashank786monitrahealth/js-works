    <h2>Advantage of a Module</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid Collisions (Namespace)</li>
        <li>Reusability - because a module is self-contained</li>
        <li>Maintainability - A module is also easier to maintain. This is because a module is decooupled from rest of the code. </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <p>A function is fantastic structure for module.</p>
    <p>Anything inside the function will have access to variables etc. Even when the function is done, that is, no longer executing.This is because of closure.</p>
    <p>We still have access to the variables and the functions - because of closure. Those two concepts make the structure of a function perfect for setting up a module - which is a set of self contained code.</p>
    <p>Many times when module pattern is used in JavaScript. It is used as a singleton. It is used only once.</p>
