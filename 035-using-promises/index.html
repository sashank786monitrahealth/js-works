<h1>What is a promise</h1>
<h3>A promise is simply a JavaScript object:</h3>
<ul>
    
    <li> An object with properties and methods </li>
    <li> We use some of those methods to take advantage of promises.</li>
    <li> Represents the eventual completion (or Failure) of an Aynchronous Operation.</li>
    <li> Promise will always provide a value - When the completion occurs, when the future event occurs - it provides a value.</li>
    
</ul>

<h3>Let's start looking at these promises with code. Say, I made a couple of functions that return promises</h3>
<p>So.. these functions are aynchronous. They do something without blocking code and then</p>
<p>when they are done - they will return a value.</p>
<p></p>
